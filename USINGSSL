Hi Xavier,

you cannot use SSL _and_ disable certificate verification.

You need to import the certificate into your truststore.

from samples/ssl/howto.txt:
----
1) Install Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) as described in the included
API User's Guide
   JSSE is included in jdk1.4. For earlier versions it is available from
        http://java.sun.com/products/jsse

        Installation steps for JSSE 1.0.2 (required for JDK1.3.X) include:
        - copy jerct.jar, jnet.jar and jsse.jar to <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext
	  (jars are included in the lib directory of the WebTest distribution)
        - install security provider in
<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/java.security
          E.g.: security.provider.3=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider

2) Import the site certificate in the cacerts keystore in order to "trust"
the site you want to test against. E.g.:
   > keytool -keystore %JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\security\cacerts -import -file
canoo.cer -alias canoo
        (The initial password for the keystore in JSSE 1.0.2 is "changeit")
